## Hello World! I'm Aniket. 👋

[cite_start]I'm a Robotics Engineer fresh from my Master's program in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at Arizona State University, and I'm on a mission to build the future of industrial automation. My passion lies at the intersection of **robotic systems**, **intelligent software**, and **real-world problem-solving**.

My ultimate goal is to launch a robotics company in India that makes warehouse automation accessible and efficient through the power of **digital twins** and **simulation-first** deployment.

* 🤖 Currently building my skills in **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** and **ROS2**.
* 🧠 Exploring new frontiers in **AI-driven perception** and **SLAM**.
* 🤝 Open to connecting with mentors, collaborators, and fellow innovators.

Let's build something amazing together.
